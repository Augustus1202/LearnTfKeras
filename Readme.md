# Learn tf.keras with some tests

This is a study project for using tf.keras.<br>
Each sub-project is committed with python code and jupyter notebook.

## fashionMNIST
Using tf.keras to build a simple classifier for fashion-MNIST data sets.

## LSTM-SIN
A simple project to test lstm in keras.<br>
Some useful feature is tested, such as TimeseriesGenerator and EarlyStopping.

# LSTM-PTB
A simple project to test lstm in keras.<br>
Use a generator class to suit the input shape in keras.
Trying model save and restore.
